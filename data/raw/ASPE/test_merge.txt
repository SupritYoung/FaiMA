Do n't get me wrong , I 'm a history geek and I appreciate that the author has clearly done his research ( having visited both Alexandria and Cairo , I found his descriptions of the cities and sights to be spot on ) , and knowing much Greek , Macedonian and Egyptian history , I appreciate that , but I , the reader , do n't need to know it all to understand the book .####[['book', 'positive'], ['author', 'positive']]

There is also the issue of whether various treatments were actually extending the lifespans of those afflicted , which was also not as simple as one might think.While the above discussion of science and statistics might make this book seem dreadfully boring , this is n't the case .####[['book', 'neutral']]
Many times I went and googled part of the story , fascinated with the history Adams presents .####[['history', 'positive']]

Although I 'm a big fan of Camilla Lackberg , Gallows Bird was n't up to the standard of the earlier 3 books which were all much better written , far better plots / better story lines , this could n't compare to her other books , plus it was so confusing and overly wordy and it did n't make that much sense .####[['Camilla Lackberg', 'positive'], ['Gallows Bird', 'negative'], ['books', 'positive'], ['plots', 'positive'], ['story lines', 'positive']]
After finishing this book , I have changed my opinion of the first two books .####[['book', 'positive']]
It is difficult to even imagine the stacks of reports , articles , notes and interviews that Dr. Mukherjee processed to produce this fabulous book .####[['book', 'positive']]
Despite the book 's length , it is fast reading , tautly plotted and engrossing .####[['book', 'negative']]
I just didn't care about the characters.Steve Berry 's The Alexandria Link is a far better read about the burial place of Alexander and has more action and suspense .####[["characters.Steve Berry 's The Alexandria Link", 'positive']]
It 's a malfunction of something already in us.One of the other reviewers of this book notes that if he had read this earlier in his life , he would have changed professions .####[['book', 'positive']]

I read Burrell 's other book , A Royal Duty and came away feeling that the author was obsessed with his employer and that he was a neurotic.Addtionally , I was inclined to think his character was somewhat questionable due to the surrounding Scotland Yard case against him ( although he was acquitted ) as well comments made by others during interviews I 've seen and other things I 've read.However , I really thought this book , The Way We Were was a nice tribute to Diana , Princes of Wales , and I think Burrell did a nice job in tyring to dispel the myths , gossip , and rumors that have surrounded this much written about subject.I particulary enjoyed reading his recollections about Diana 's relationship with Hasnat Khan and his two sons ' recollections of their childhood friendship with Princes William and Harry .####[['Way', 'positive'], ['job', 'positive']]

There 's many ways to end a story , but whatever ` chapter ` or I suspect chapters are defective , it reads like the TV show 24 set on the Star War 's Planet Alderaan and then unbeknownst , the Death Star shows up after 400 pages and so much for 400 pages of Alderaan '24 ' intrigue ... everyone dies ( although Midkemia has been exhibiting some narrative changing resurrections in this 2-book installment ) .The hardback is not inexpensive .####[['hardback', 'neutral']]

A fairly good plot , some very good historical information , but with very cookie cutter characters - the hero who gets in and out of trouble repeatedly , the villains who are after the hero but continue to miss their opportunity to put an end to him , the sidekick who helps the hero out of several jams , and in this case unlike some others in this space , a rather weak female lead.Descriptions of the sites are done very well and at a good level of detail , putting you right there with the characters .####[['lead.Descriptions', 'positive'], ['characters', 'negative'], ['historical information', 'positive'], ['plot', 'positive']]

I 'm not sure how anyone who has read Robin Hobb 's prior books , not just this trilogy but the three others she 's written , can read this book and say it disapoints and isn't as good as the others.I mean OK folks can certainly have their opinion but to me this books is just as good as the other books in the Soldiars Son trilogy and on equal footing with her other trilogy finale books.What I truly enjoy about her characters is that they become so real for me , they aren't 100 % good or bad and they are always ruled by events and the stuff that life throws at them and are ultimately just as fallible as we real world humans are .####[['characters', 'positive'], ['books', 'positive']]

Always an enjoyable read - I 've been reading this author ( and her spouse 's ) books for many years .####[['author', 'positive'], ['books', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive']]
Christina Lamb has written an intensely personal and engaging account of the people , places , mistakes , history , lessons learned and lessons not learned in this ongoing conflict .####[['account', 'positive']]
The character is n't active enough to be interesting and it took me a lot longer to read because I put it down out of tiredness .####[['character', 'negative']]
The other factor that really pissed me off was the editing of the book .####[['editing', 'negative']]
I kept reading and reading thinking that the author would pull it alltogether at the end , but the end was disappointing , too .####[['end', 'negative']]
I still miss DI Insch , but DI Steel is once again at her entertaining foul-mouthed best , McRae also has more to cope with in terms of his barely-competent colleague 'Beardy ' Beattie being promoted to DI ahead of him , and several other colourful characters are also introduced .####[['DI Insch', 'positive']]
And on this incredible journey into the depths of that darkness , what an absolutely marvelous guide is this modern day Virgil called Siddharta Mukherjee as he leads us on this long and often harrowing journey through the swarth that cancer has cut through mankind throughout time.Mukherjee is a veritable kaleidoscope .####[['Siddharta Mukherjee', 'positive']]
While doing all of this the alchemy of Mukherjee 's writing continually turns science into poetry and poetry into science.Simply put , it is so good , and so incandescently clear and lucid , and so powerful , and so engrossing , and so easily consumed that you will not lay it down without someone or circumstances forcing you to.Had I read this book in my teens I would have found my life 's career .####[['book', 'positive'], ["Mukherjee 's writing", 'positive']]
I would recommend this book to others that are interested in the subject matter .####[['book', 'positive']]

I 'm very glad I did -- they fit perfectly.These do n't seem like they 're necessarily the best quality shoes -- which is to say that I think they 're better for casual or beginning dancers who wo n't be as rough on them as professional or competitive dancers would be .####[['they', 'positive']]

Although these are n't perfect , they are VERY comfortable and I 'll be purchasing them again when my current pair is torn up .####[['they', 'neutral'], ['them', 'positive']]

The shoes arrived the next day and were too small to wear .####[['shoes', 'negative']]
but price is right so this is my second oair .####[['price', 'positive']]

It 's good to wear and be able to slip into cute shoes after .####[['shoes', 'positive']]

She wore them for a few rehearsals and two recitals and they are still doing well .####[['them', 'positive']]

It was a little scary pulling them on the first time though as I thought they weren't going to fit .####[['them', 'negative']]
The LifeStride 's I ordered in 6.5 C/D were much closer to a 6 narrow !####[["LifeStride 's", 'negative']]
O ordered them for a friend and she loved them .####[['them', 'positive']]
Everything else about these tights is amazing .####[['tights', 'positive']]

6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .####[['case', 'negative']]
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .####[['screen', 'negative']]
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['hd size', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .####[['customer service', 'negative'], ['technical support', 'negative']]
controls are a bit awkward .####[['controls', 'negative']]
but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .####[['itunes', 'negative']]
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !####[['dvd player', 'negative']]
additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )####[['tones', 'positive'], ['wallpapers', 'positive'], ['screensaver', 'positive'], ['stop clock', 'positive'], ['alarm', 'positive'], ['java applications', 'positive']]
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !####[['design', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['battery duration', 'positive']]
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .####[['spot metering', 'positive']]
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .####[['pics', 'positive'], ['prints', 'positive']]
but this camera is great !####[['camera', 'positive']]
i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .####[['apex', 'negative'], ['amazon', 'positive']]
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .####[['lock-out button', 'negative']]
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .####[['manual', 'positive'], ['understand', 'positive']]
software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )####[['software', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !####[['controls', 'positive']]
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .####[['stoppage', 'positive']]
output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .####[['output', 'positive']]
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .####[['camera', 'positive']]
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .####[['transfer', 'positive']]
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .####[['canon computer software', 'positive']]
however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .####[['clip', 'negative']]
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .####[['canon g3', 'positive']]
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .####[['optical', 'positive'], ['coax digital audio outputs', 'positive']]
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .####[['shuttle music', 'positive']]
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !####[['form-factor', 'positive'], ['front panel', 'positive'], ['look', 'positive']]
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .####[['scroll bar problems', 'negative']]
having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .####[['transfers', 'positive']]

in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said####[['scroll bar', 'negative']]
3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .####[['dvd player froze', 'negative']]
one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .####[['feature', 'positive']]
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .####[['features', 'positive'], ['menus', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]
i tried to play the song three times , with no success .####[['play', 'negative']]

it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .####[['internet browsing', 'positive']]
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['eax', 'negative']]
i love the storage in this thing .####[['storage', 'positive']]
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .####[['screen', 'positive'], ['read', 'positive'], ['silver unit', 'positive']]
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .####[['price', 'positive']]
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .####[['software', 'negative'], ['use', 'negative']]
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .####[['controls', 'positive']]
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .####[['eax features', 'positive'], ['eq adjustments', 'positive']]
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .####[['plays', 'positive'], ['dvds', 'positive'], ['cds', 'positive'], ['mp3s', 'positive'], ['jpegs', 'positive']]
when talking the voice is not very clear .####[['voice', 'negative']]
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .####[['ripping', 'positive']]
the service from the supplier was exceptional .####[['service', 'positive']]
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .####[['auto-focus assist light', 'negative']]
loved the slim design .####[['design', 'positive']]
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .####[['play', 'negative'], ['dvd', 'negative']]
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .####[['set up', 'positive']]
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .####[['auto-focus', 'positive']]
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .####[['import', 'positive'], ['move', 'positive']]
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .####[['quality', 'positive'], ['g3 hardware', 'positive']]
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .####[['camera', 'positive']]
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .####[['keys', 'positive']]
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .####[['color', 'positive']]
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .####[['headphones', 'negative']]
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .####[['battery life', 'positive'], ['fm radio', 'positive'], ['signal', 'positive'], ['speakerphone', 'positive'], ['java apps', 'positive']]
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .####[['feel', 'positive'], ['weight', 'positive']]
nice little phone ... light compact . .####[['phone', 'positive']]
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .####[['shutter delay', 'positive']]
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !####[['sunset feature', 'positive']]
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .####[['size', 'positive'], ['weight', 'positive'], ['navigational system', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?####[['ringtones', 'positive']]
second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .####[['menu system', 'negative'], ['controls', 'negative'], ['designed', 'negative']]

it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .####[['manual', 'positive']]
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .####[['transfering', 'positive'], ['software', 'positive']]
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !####[['notmad', 'positive']]
you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .####[['navigate', 'negative'], ['genre', 'negative'], ['artist', 'negative'], ['album', 'negative']]
- uploading music is quick and easy .####[['uploading music', 'positive']]
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .####[['equalizer settings', 'positive'], ['range', 'positive'], ['choices', 'positive']]
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]

i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the light auto-correction is awesome .####[['light auto-correction', 'positive']]
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .####[['plays', 'positive'], ['dvds', 'positive']]
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .####[['sound quality', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive'], ['player', 'negative']]
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .####[['size', 'negative']]
poor visibility on the keys .####[['visibility', 'negative'], ['keys', 'negative']]
the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['earbuds', 'negative']]
- the software that came with it was tough to load .####[['software', 'negative'], ['load', 'negative']]
output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .####[['output', 'negative']]
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .####[['viewfinder', 'negative']]
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['operate', 'positive']]
so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !####[['dvd player', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
the image quality is excellent .####[['image quality', 'positive']]
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .####[['features', 'positive'], ['player', 'positive']]
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['colorimetry', 'positive']]
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .####[['player', 'positive']]
12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !####[['storage', 'positive']]
even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .####[['optional headset', 'positive']]
3 ) 4x zoom is nice####[['4x zoom', 'positive']]
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .####[['reading svcds', 'positive'], ['vbr mp3 cds', 'positive']]
touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .####[['redeye', 'positive'], ['alter', 'positive'], ['correct', 'positive']]
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .####[['voice dialing', 'negative']]
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .####[['features', 'positive'], ['size', 'positive'], ['layout', 'positive'], ['remote', 'positive']]
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .####[['on/off button', 'negative']]
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .####[['remote buttons', 'negative']]
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .####[['mediasource', 'negative'], ['user interface', 'negative']]
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .####[['canon g3', 'positive']]

the storage capacity is great for me --####[['storage capacity', 'positive']]
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !####[['performance', 'positive']]

4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .####[['folder structure', 'negative']]
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .####[['basic usage', 'positive']]
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['external flash', 'positive'], ['lense', 'positive'], ['filters choices', 'positive']]
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .####[['notmad software', 'positive']]
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .####[['size', 'positive']]
works great !####[['works', 'positive']]
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .####[['price', 'positive'], ['sound', 'positive']]

when the player was working it was great ,but .####[['player', 'negative']]
3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .####[['folders', 'negative']]
the battery is nice .####[['battery', 'positive']]
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .####[['player', 'positive']]
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .####[['compact flash', 'positive'], ['rechargable battery', 'positive'], ['charging unit', 'positive']]
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this####[['use', 'positive']]
cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .####[['construction', 'negative']]
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .####[['slr like programming', 'positive'], ['exposure control', 'positive'], ['program', 'positive'], ['auto exposure settings', 'positive']]
the interface used could be better designed .####[['interface', 'negative'], ['designed', 'negative']]
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .####[['dial', 'positive'], ['photo quality', 'positive']]
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .####[['player', 'positive']]
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )####[['picture quality', 'positive']]
i bought the player this week and i like it by far .####[['player', 'positive']]
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .####[['picture', 'positive']]
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .####[['canon g3', 'positive']]
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .####[['case', 'positive']]
a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .####[['player', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive'], ['software', 'negative'], ['ripping', 'negative'], ['transferring', 'negative']]
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['leather case', 'positive']]
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .####[['software', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]

all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .####[['buttons', 'positive']]
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .####[['viewfinder', 'negative']]
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .####[['cell phone', 'positive']]
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .####[['apex', 'negative']]
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !####[['case', 'positive']]
the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .####[['focus', 'negative'], ['shoot', 'negative']]
this is a good deal for music and data storage .####[['deal', 'positive'], ['music', 'positive'], ['data storage', 'positive']]

flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .####[['built-in flashes', 'negative']]
this player seems to work fine with everything else .####[['player', 'positive'], ['work', 'positive']]
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .####[['machine', 'positive'], ['fits', 'positive']]

great camera , great investment !####[['camera', 'positive']]
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .####[['customer service rep', 'negative']]
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .####[['transferring', 'positive']]
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .####[['operating', 'positive']]
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .####[['camera', 'positive']]
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .####[['progressive scan dvd player', 'negative'], ['quality', 'negative']]

in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .####[['customer reps', 'positive']]
so far the software for the pc works easily .####[['software', 'positive']]
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .####[['ringtones', 'positive'], ['memory', 'negative']]
* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .####[['scroll button', 'negative']]
it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['function', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive'], ['customer service', 'negative']]
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .####[['phone', 'positive']]

although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .####[['last', 'positive'], ['recharge', 'positive']]
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .####[['manual', 'positive']]
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .####[['headphone jack', 'negative']]
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .####[['screen', 'positive']]
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .####[['dvd player', 'positive']]
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .####[['software', 'positive']]
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .####[['navigate', 'positive'], ['button', 'negative']]
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .####[['signals', 'negative'], ['pictures', 'negative']]
the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .####[['sound', 'positive'], ['form factore', 'positive']]
the vibration is not top .####[['vibration', 'negative']]
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !####[['speaker', 'positive']]

there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .####[['features', 'positive'], ['eax', 'positive'], ['customization', 'positive']]
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .####[['ear-piece', 'positive']]
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .####[['operate', 'positive']]
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .####[['flip switch', 'positive']]
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .####[['sound quality', 'positive']]
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .####[['battery life', 'negative']]
i highly recommend this phone to anyone .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the storage capacity is great .####[['storage capacity', 'positive']]
scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .####[['button', 'negative'], ['scroll wheel', 'negative']]
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .####[['scroll wheel', 'positive']]
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .####[['tiff format', 'negative']]
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .####[['use', 'positive']]
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .####[['recognize', 'negative'], ['dvds', 'negative']]
the entire unit was poorly crafted .####[['unit', 'negative'], ['crafted', 'negative']]
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .####[['navigating', 'positive'], ['menus', 'positive']]
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .####[['construction', 'negative'], ['front panel', 'negative']]
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .####[['size', 'positive'], ['speakerphone option', 'positive'], ['calling plan', 'positive'], ['access', 'positive']]
and also , it 's priced very affordably .####[['priced', 'positive']]
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .####[['quality', 'positive'], ['pictures', 'positive'], ['ways', 'positive']]
this phone is highly recommended otherwise .####[['phone', 'positive']]
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .####[['camera', 'positive']]
this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .####[['phone', 'positive'], ['battery life', 'positive']]
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !####[['playlist', 'positive']]
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .####[['voice dialing', 'positive']]
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .####[['sound options', 'positive'], ['equalizer', 'positive']]
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .####[['headphone jack', 'negative']]
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .####[['codes', 'negative']]
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .####[['canon', 'positive'], ['picture quality', 'positive']]
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .####[['battery life', 'negative']]
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .####[['case', 'negative']]
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .####[['unresponsiveness', 'negative']]
great camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .####[['replacement battery', 'positive']]
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .####[['creating playlists', 'negative']]
great price .####[['price', 'positive']]
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .####[['sound', 'positive']]
the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .####[['file transfer', 'negative']]
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .####[['nikon coolpix line', 'positive']]
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .####[['dvds', 'positive']]
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .####[['navigation', 'negative']]
the battery life is amazing .####[['battery life', 'positive']]
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .####[['radio function', 'negative']]
the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .####[['feels', 'positive']]
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .####[['equipment', 'positive']]
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .####[['internal flash', 'negative']]
i am quite happy with the camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .####[['lcd', 'negative'], ['read', 'negative']]
for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .####[['read', 'negative']]
the included earbuds were uncomfortable .uncomfortable -1####[['earbuds', 'negative']]
playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .####[['playlists', 'positive'], ['play modes', 'positive']]
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .####[['software', 'negative']]
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .####[['sound', 'positive']]
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .####[['rechargable battery', 'negative'], ['last', 'negative']]
2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .####[['remote', 'negative']]
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .####[['speakerphone', 'positive']]
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player####[['pause', 'positive']]
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .####[['phone', 'positive']]
- large easy readable screen####[['screen', 'positive']]
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .####[['play', 'negative']]
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .####[['quality', 'positive'], ['raw images', 'positive']]
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .####[['size', 'positive']]
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .####[['looking', 'negative'], ['shots', 'negative']]
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .####[['quality', 'positive'], ['durability', 'positive']]
t-mobile was a pretty good server .####[['t-mobile', 'positive']]
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .####[['software', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .####[['of', 'negative']]
i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .####[['support', 'negative']]
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .####[['looks', 'positive']]
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .####[['adjust', 'negative'], ['balance', 'negative']]
really happy with this little camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .####[['ringing tones', 'positive'], ['radio', 'positive']]
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .####[['freezes', 'negative']]
but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .####[['picture', 'negative']]
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .####[['color', 'negative']]
the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .####[['player', 'positive']]
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .####[['remote unit', 'positive']]
very simple to use .####[['use', 'positive']]
all in all suprisingly easy to use .####[['use', 'positive']]
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .####[['playing', 'negative'], ['dvds', 'negative'], ['recognize', 'negative']]
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .####[['manual functionality', 'positive'], ['downloading pictures', 'positive'], ['quality', 'positive']]
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .####[['battery life', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .####[['4x optical zoom', 'positive']]
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .####[['g3', 'positive'], ['image quality', 'positive']]
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .####[['front cover', 'negative']]
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .####[['toggle button', 'negative'], ['designed', 'negative'], ['work', 'negative']]
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .####[['t-zones', 'negative']]
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .####[['camera', 'positive']]
2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .####[['id3', 'negative']]
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .####[['lense cap', 'positive']]
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .####[['viewfinder', 'negative']]
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .####[['hard drive', 'negative']]
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .####[['megapixel', 'positive'], ['manual control', 'positive']]
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .####[['speakerphone option', 'positive']]
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .####[['wake-up feature', 'positive']]
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .####[['battery', 'positive']]
the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .####[['gprs connection', 'negative'], ['aol instant messenger software', 'negative'], ['t-zones applications', 'positive']]
* software is absolutely terrible :####[['software', 'negative']]
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .####[['transfer', 'positive']]
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['quality point', 'positive'], ['price range', 'positive']]
it has a classic design yet looks hip .####[['design', 'positive']]
radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpiece in .####[['radio', 'positive'], ['work', 'negative']]
9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .####[['3x built-in optical zoom', 'positive']]
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .####[['software interface', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .####[['headphone jack', 'negative']]
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .####[['select songs', 'negative'], ['playlist creation', 'negative']]
the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .####[['software', 'negative'], ['mediasource', 'negative']]
it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .####[['play', 'negative']]
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .####[['product', 'positive']]
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :####[['menu options', 'negative'], ['sending messages', 'negative']]
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .####[['bookmarks', 'negative']]
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .####[['equipment', 'positive']]
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .####[['volume control', 'negative']]
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .####[['plays mpeg video', 'positive']]
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .####[['8mb card', 'negative']]
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).####[['earphones', 'negative'], ['software', 'negative']]
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .####[['dvd-rs', 'positive']]
retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .####[['display', 'positive']]
overall , i highly recommend this phone .####[['phone', 'positive']]
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .####[['auto setting', 'positive']]
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .####[['flywheel', 'negative']]
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .####[['notmad software', 'positive']]
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .####[['digital camera', 'positive']]
however , the creative software is not real intuitive .####[['software', 'negative']]
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .####[['customer service dept', 'negative']]
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .####[['storage', 'positive']]
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .####[['player', 'positive'], ['features', 'positive']]
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .####[['mms pictures', 'positive']]
b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .####[['lens cover', 'negative']]
difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .####[['navigation', 'negative'], ['scrollwheel', 'negative']]
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .####[['shape', 'positive'], ['balance', 'positive']]
i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .####[['audio aspects', 'positive']]
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .####[['macro mode', 'positive']]
the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .####[['phone book', 'positive'], ['speakerphone', 'positive']]
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .####[['interface', 'positive']]
after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .####[['customer support telephone number', 'negative']]
3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players####[['work', 'negative']]
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .####[['unit', 'positive'], ['video output', 'negative']]
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !####[['replacement warranty', 'negative']]
b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .####[['mediasource cd ripping', 'positive']]
i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .####[['dvd player', 'positive']]
the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .####[['software', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive'], ['mastered', 'positive']]
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .####[['viewfinder', 'negative']]
but the major problem i had was with the software .####[['software', 'negative']]
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .####[['software', 'negative']]
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .####[['view-finder', 'negative']]
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .####[['optical viewfinder', 'negative']]
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .####[['fly wheel', 'negative']]
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .####[['reception', 'negative']]
do not buy this product --####[['product', 'negative']]
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .####[['camera', 'positive']]
honestly , i love this player .####[['player', 'positive']]
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .####[['apex player', 'positive']]
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .####[['remote', 'negative']]
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .####[['audio quality', 'positive']]
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .####[['sound', 'positive']]
the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly####[['display', 'positive']]
7 picture quality is excellent .####[['picture quality', 'positive']]
i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .####[['buttons', 'negative'], ['placed', 'positive']]
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .####[['scroll tab', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .####[['auto mode', 'negative']]
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .####[['jpeg slideshows', 'positive'], ['mpeg1 files', 'positive']]
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .####[['camera', 'negative']]
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .####[['reception', 'positive']]
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .####[['construction', 'negative']]
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .####[['software', 'negative'], ['wma audio format', 'negative'], ['sound quality', 'negative']]
because this camera is beautiful .####[['camera', 'positive']]
i love all of the features , and presets as well .####[['presets', 'positive']]
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .####[['controls', 'negative'], ['looking', 'negative']]
oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .####[['file transfers', 'positive']]
the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .####[['key', 'negative']]
the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .####[['aff feature', 'positive']]
night mode is clear as day .####[['night mode', 'positive']]
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .####[['functionality', 'positive']]
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .####[['controls', 'negative']]
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .####[['lens cap', 'negative'], ['lens', 'negative'], ['viewfinder', 'negative']]
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .####[['phone', 'positive']]
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .####[['dvd door', 'negative']]
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .####[['software', 'negative'], ['driver', 'negative']]
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !####[['camera', 'positive']]
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .####[['nomad explorer', 'positive'], ['functionality', 'positive']]
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .####[['playback quality', 'positive']]
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .####[['pics', 'positive'], ['use', 'positive']]
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .####[['aiff', 'positive'], ['progressive scan feature', 'positive']]
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .####[['customer service line', 'negative']]
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .####[['weight', 'positive'], ['signal strength', 'positive']]
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .####[['case', 'positive']]
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .####[['playback', 'positive']]
the included memory card is too small .####[['memory card', 'negative']]
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .####[['manual mode', 'positive'], ['feature', 'positive']]
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .####[['feel', 'positive']]
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .####[['internet functions', 'negative']]
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .####[['nokia', 'positive']]
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !####[['digital zoom', 'positive'], ['optical zoom', 'positive']]
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .####[['battery', 'positive'], ['recharge', 'positive']]
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .####[['camera', 'positive'], ['price', 'positive']]
this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .####[['size', 'positive']]
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .####[['cd ripping', 'positive']]
the price compared to the ipod is great .####[['price', 'positive']]
the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .####[['zoom', 'negative']]
also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .####[['shipping', 'positive'], ['tax', 'positive'], ['player', 'positive']]
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .####[['quality', 'positive'], ['photos', 'positive'], ['auto mode', 'positive']]
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .####[['player', 'negative']]
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .####[['user interface', 'negative']]
set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .####[['set up', 'positive']]
- bright , visible screen####[['screen', 'positive']]
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .####[['lcd screen', 'positive']]
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel####[['build quality', 'negative']]
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .####[['case', 'negative']]
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .####[['digital camera', 'positive']]
creative labs customer support website is useless .####[['customer support website', 'negative']]
mediasource did not recognize my tags !####[['mediasource', 'negative']]
- included creative software is pretty poor .####[['software', 'negative']]
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .####[['menu dial knob', 'negative']]

the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .####[['mobile text messaging', 'positive'], ['chat', 'positive'], ['picture sharing', 'positive']]
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .####[['battery', 'positive']]
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .####[['mp3 player', 'positive'], ['memory', 'positive']]
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .####[['zooming lever', 'negative']]
the camera was a marvel .####[['camera', 'positive']]
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .####[['jog dial', 'negative']]
